# Optodroplets
Small script to analyze fluorescence microscopy images of light-dependent formation of optodroplets in living cells.<br/>

## What does this script do?
* simple segmentation of the nucleus
* exclusion of larger aggregates that are already present before blue light illumination
* quantification of:
  * concentration of the protein of interest (i. e. mean nuclear fluorescence intensity)
  * optodroplet abundance (i. e. normalized coefficient of variation of nuclear fluorescence intensity)
* fit of the data to compare different proteins of interest
* outputs:
  * text file listing the above-mentioned parameters for each cell
  * pdf with a basic droplet abundance vs. concentration plot
  * fit parameters (only in R command line)
  * optional: an image with the created nuclear and aggregate masks for visual inspection (for each cell)

## How is this script used?

### Requirements
* R version 4.0 (tested with 4.0.1 & 4.0.5)
* R packages:
  * [EBImage](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/EBImage.html) version 4.29.2
  * [this.path](https://cran.r-project.org/package=this.path) version 0.4.4

### Running the analysis on the test data set
* Install the listed requirements via [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/) (for [EBImage](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/EBImage.html)) or directly in R (for [this.path](https://cran.r-project.org/package=this.path) via `install.packages("this.path")`)
* Download the [functions](https://github.com/AnneRademacher/Optodroplets/tree/main/functions) and [example_data](https://github.com/AnneRademacher/Optodroplets/tree/main/example_data) folders as well as the R script [optodroplets_induction.R](https://github.com/AnneRademacher/Optodroplets/blob/main/optodroplets_induction.R) into one folder on your local computer (note that [example_data](https://github.com/AnneRademacher/Optodroplets/tree/main/example_data) is about 250 MB and contains the full data set from Fig. 4 of Rademacher *et al.* (2021) listed below)
* Run the R script [optodroplets_induction.R](https://github.com/AnneRademacher/Optodroplets/blob/main/optodroplets_induction.R) either in R Studio or from the R console using `source("optodroplets_induction.R")`
